# bikesharing
## Overview
In this challenge we needed to gather data to show potential investors reasons a bikesharing company is a good idea in Des Moines. In order to prove this, we took the August citi bike data for New York City and used the data to make some visulations. We then use those visualtions too show the investors common questions and there solutions.

## Summary
The challenge this week helps us have an idea of how a bikesharing company of our own may play out. Each one of our visualtions have a story to tell and can answer a number of questions. However I think having a visulation to look at how long none subscribed users take to ride the bike, to give us an idea as to how interested people are to trying out our service. Another visulation is looking at the age our subscribers are to have a good understanding of our target audience.
